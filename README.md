# focus-timer

a simple web-based focus timer (stopwatch) app
i use timers and stopwatches a lot at work, and i found a similar software to this that i really liked
but they were charging $100/year to basically have custom backgrounds and to play custom sounds,
so i figured i would just try to re-make it myself instead~
